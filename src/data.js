        content: "The two biggest things Clingan has going for him are that he’s a great shot blocker and a solid rim runner. Offensively, he doesn’t really have much of a post game, and I actually question his ability to create for himself. However, I think he’s a little underrated as a passer, and he’s easily the best passing big man in this class. One of the things I keep hearing about him is that he has shooting up-side, but I don’t understand this one bit. I guess he had some solid shooting workouts recently, but he shot 58% from the free throw line and only made two threes in his career. Players can always improve their shooting, but that free throw percentage doesn’t give me much hope. Defensively, he’s a good rim protector, has a strong presence down low, and has shown some flashes of being able to guard on the perimeter. Overall I really like Clingan. He’s a high floor/high ceiling type of guy, and that’s why he should be a top five pick."

His poor decision making (he turns it over a lot) and lack of playmaking ability is really concerning. He tries to make up for it with hustle plays, chase down blocks, and athletic finishes in transition, but it isn’t enough for me to have confidence in him as a prospect. He could really thrive as a slasher and role player for a team that already has established playmakers, but he’ll never be a go-to guy. "
